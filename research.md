Abstract: Traditional measures of inequality, such as the Gini coefficient, involve pairwise comparisons across all members of a given population. But, most people possess information about, and therefore experience inequality in comparison to, only a subset of the population. In this paper, we provide simple axioms to describe inequality as experienced in social networks. We propose an index to measure aggregate experienced inequality that is consistent with these axioms. We then compute the Gini coefficient and ‘experienced inequality’ in 75 villages in Karnataka, India. We show that for a given wealth distribution, the social network could either accentuate or diminish experienced inequality. We show, first analytically and then empirically, how this can happen with respect to two network properties. Firstly, wealth-based homophily is negatively associated with experienced inequality. Secondly, caste-based homophily is negatively associated with experienced inequality when within-caste inequality is less than the overall Gini coefficient (and positively associated when the opposite is true).


Girardi, Daniele, Sai Madhurika Mamunuru, Simon D. Halliday, and Samuel Bowles. "Does studying economics make you selfish?." *Southern Economic Journal* 90, no. 3 (2024): 792-814.

It is widely held that studying economics makes you more selfish and politically conservative. We use a difference-in-differences strategy to disentangle the causal impact of economics education from selection effects. We estimate the effect of four different intermediate microeconomics courses on students' experimentally elicited social preferences and beliefs about others, and policy opinions. We find no discernible effect of studying economics (whatever the course content) on self-interest or beliefs about others' self-interest. Results on policy preferences also point to little effect, except that economics may make students somewhat less opposed to highly restrictive immigration policies.

While there is a standard Walrasian approach to teaching intermediate microeconomics, there is no such template for instructors that want to go beyond this conventional framework. This paper’s purpose is to assist instructors with developing intermediate microeconomics courses that go beyond the Walrasian model, reflect the real world, incorporate advances in economics research, and are pedagogically inclusive. First, we develop a taxonomy of existing approaches to help instructors identify which approach best fits their intellectual and teaching philosophy. Next, we offer two detailed and vetted course design examples within this taxonomy. We then summarize the textbooks, topics, and assignments typically used in courses that cover more than the conventional Walrasian model.
